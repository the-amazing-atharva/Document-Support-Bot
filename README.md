## How To Install

You must already have `Node.js` and `npm` installed already on your machine. Then `git clone` this repo locally. Once everything is downloaded you will need to open a terminal and change directories to the Document-Support-Bot folder. Once there `touch .env` and then `npm install`. I am using `nodemon` and `express` in this project so it can make API calls to a few services and keep running unless it encounters an error. Once everything is installed go into your editor and put in the values needed for the `TOKEN="...."` and `CLIENT_ID="..."` which you can find in the Discord Devloper portal and you are set. Run the bot with `npm start`.
